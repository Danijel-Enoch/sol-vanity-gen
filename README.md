# Vanaddy

Vanaddy is a Rust-based utility for generating Solana keypairs and finding an input vanity sting at the beginning of the addy.
It process concurrently to efficiently search for public keys that match a user-defined vanity string.


## Features

- **Vanity String Matching**: Searches for Solana public keys that start with a specified vanity string.
- **Case Sensitivity**: The matching process is case-sensitive, ensuring precise alignment with the user's requirements.
- **Multi-threading Support**: Utilizes multiple threads to speed up the search process, with the thread count definable by the user (approx. 1 billion addy's a day)
- **CSV Logging**: Records found public keys in a CSV file for easy access and reference.

- On an Apple silicon M1 machine 6 threads was approx 50% cpu load ,it will ask hoa many threads you want use.
